    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Spaghetti (or any long pasta)</li>
      <li>Eggs (usually 2 whole + 1 yolk per serving)</li>
      <li>
        Pancetta or guanciale (Italian cured pork — can substitute with bacon if
        needed)
      </li>
      <li>Pecorino Romano cheese (grated)</li>
      <li>Parmesan cheese (optional, for milder flavor)</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>
        Salt (for pasta water only — the cheese and pancetta are already salty)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the pasta:</strong> Boil spaghetti in salted water until al
        dente. Reserve about one cup of pasta water before draining.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the pancetta:</strong> In a large pan, cook pancetta or
        guanciale over medium heat until crisp. Remove from heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the sauce:</strong> In a bowl, whisk together eggs, grated
        Pecorino Romano, and plenty of black pepper until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combine everything:</strong> Add hot drained pasta to the pan
        with pancetta (off the heat). Quickly pour in the egg-cheese mixture and
        toss vigorously, adding a splash of pasta water to create a creamy
        sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adjust consistency:</strong> Add more cheese or a bit more pasta
        water until silky and smooth — not runny.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve immediately:</strong> Top with extra Pecorino and freshly
        cracked black pepper.
      </li>
    </ol>
